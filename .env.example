NUXT_AUTH_SECRET="your_strong_production_secret_here"
# For development, you might have used a simpler key in your actual .env,
# but the .env.example should always prompt for a secure production key.

# You might also need to specify your production origin for Nuxt Auth
# NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_ORIGIN="https://yourdomain.com"
# (Check nuxt.config.ts for how origin is set - it might use NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_ORIGIN or a similar env var for production)

# Database URL (if you were using a remote DB, not applicable for local sqlite.db)
# DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"

# Add any other environment variables your application might need here.
# For example, API keys for external services, etc.
